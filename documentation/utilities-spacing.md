# utilities/spacing.scss

## Spacing Classes

This files generates classes to control spacing. You shouldn't need to do much in this file unless you need negative margins or spacing classes smaller than `1em`.

In the `settings/variables.scss` file you can change the `max-spacing` variable to add more classes for spacing.
