# components/jv-classes.scss

Use this file to edit the built-in styles created by Jobvite.

## Main Sections

* JV Wrapper
    * The `.jv-wrapper` class is used to constrain the width of page content. It's similar to Bootsrap's `.container`. Here you can adjust the padding on either side of the padding. The `max-width` is also set here.
* JV Logo
* Job List Page
* Job Detail Page
* Apply Page
* Apply Confirm
* Tools
    * The Job Seeker Tools macro replaces standard General Apply, Check Application, and Job Alerts.
